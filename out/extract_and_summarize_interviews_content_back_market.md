### Defining the Staff-plus Role at Back Market 🔍

**What it is:**

The Staff-plus role at Back Market is a leadership position within the Individual Contributor track. It's distinct from both Senior Engineer and Engineering Manager roles. Staff-plus engineers operate with a company-wide perspective, focusing on impactful initiatives that may take time to be visible but significantly contribute to Back Market's long-term success.
While the Staff-plus role is fluid and adapts to the company's needs, certain archetypes help define the different facets of the position:

* **Architect:**  Focusing on high-level system design, technical direction, and empowering teams to make good decisions.
* **Tech Lead:** Guiding and mentoring teams, often taking a hands-on approach to problem-solving and knowledge sharing.
* **Right Hand:** Acting as a strategic advisor and support system for senior leadership, particularly during transitions or leadership gaps.
* **Solver:** Deep diving into complex technical challenges, often taking ownership of critical issues and finding solutions.

**Influence without authority** is an essential characteristic of the role. Staff-plus engineers lack the formal power of managers, yet they are expected to drive initiatives and shape technical direction.

The day-to-day responsibilities vary greatly depending on the individual and the company's needs. However, typical tasks include:

* **Strategic planning and roadmap discussions:** Participating in conversations about company-wide initiatives, technical direction, and resource allocation.
* **Architecture reviews and technical guidance:** Providing feedback on system design, code quality, and technical decisions.
* **Mentorship and coaching:** Guiding and supporting other engineers, fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous learning.
* **Exploration and experimentation:** Investigating new technologies and approaches, acting as a catalyst for innovation within the company.
* **"Being glue":** Taking ownership of critical issues and doing whatever it takes to move things forward.

Measuring success is a nuanced challenge, as the impact of Staff-plus engineers is often long-term and difficult to quantify. Several strategies emerge:

* **Feedback loops:** Regularly seeking feedback from managers, peers, and stakeholders to gauge the effectiveness of their work.
* **Recognizing one’s influence in the success of others:** Identifying instances where their efforts have improved team performance, architecture, or company-wide initiatives. Recognizing when their work has made a tangible difference and contributed to positive change.

**What it isn't:**

* **A purely technical role:** While technical expertise is essential, Staff-plus engineers leverage their soft skills and leadership abilities to influence, empower, and guide others.
* **A management position:** Staff-plus engineers don't directly manage teams but work collaboratively with managers and individual contributors to drive initiatives.
* **A fixed archetype:**  Staff-plus engineers embody different archetypes (Tech Lead, Architect, Right-Hand, Solver) depending on the company's needs and their own interests.
